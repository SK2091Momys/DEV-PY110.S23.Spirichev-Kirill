Whether you\u2019re a practicing machine-learning engineer, a software developer, or a college student, you\u2019ll find value in these pages. This book offers a practical, hands-on exploration of deep learning. It avoids mathematical notation, preferring instead to explain quantitative concepts via code snippets and to build practical intuition about the core ideas of machine learning and deep learning. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn from more than 30 code examples that include detailed commentary, practical recommendations, and simple high-level explanations of everything you need to know to start using deep learning to solve concrete problems. The code examples use the Python deep-learning framework Keras, with Tensor- Flow as a back-end engine. Keras, one of the most popular and fastest-growing deeplearning frameworks, is widely recommended as the best tool to get started with deep learning."
